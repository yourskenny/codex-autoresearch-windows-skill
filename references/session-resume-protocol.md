# Session Resume Protocol

Detect and recover from interrupted runs. Resume from the last consistent retained state instead of guessing from stale artifacts.

## Workspace-Owned Control Plane

The only supported normal artifact layout is workspace-owned:

```text
<workspace_root>/autoresearch-results/results.tsv
<workspace_root>/autoresearch-results/state.json
<workspace_root>/autoresearch-results/launch.json
<workspace_root>/autoresearch-results/runtime.json
<workspace_root>/autoresearch-results/runtime.log
<workspace_root>/autoresearch-results/lessons.md
<workspace_root>/autoresearch-results/context.json
```

Each managed git repo also stores a git-local pointer at:

```bash
git rev-parse --git-path codex-autoresearch/pointer.json
```

Hooks, status, stop, and resume resolve context in this order: current repo pointer, canonical `autoresearch-results/context.json`, then fail with a clear error. Do not walk upward from cwd looking for guessed contexts, and do not infer repo identity from a results path.

## JSON State File

The primary recovery source is `autoresearch-results/state.json`, an atomic-write snapshot updated after each main iteration. Schema:

Write protocol: write to a uniquely named temporary file in the same directory, fsync, then rename to `state.json` (atomic). Never commit the Results directory.

`config.session_mode` is the authoritative interactive-mode marker. It distinguishes foreground runs from background managed runs. Foreground runs resume from `results.tsv` plus `state.json`. Background runs also require a confirmed `launch.json` in the same Results directory.

If an existing interactive run switches from foreground to background or back again, synchronize `state.json` to the chosen mode before continuing. The human-facing skill flow should do this internally when it resumes in the other mode; scripted background `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py start` performs the same sync automatically before it relaunches nested Codex sessions, and the bundled `autoresearch_set_session_mode.py` helper remains an internal/scripted recovery escape hatch rather than a normal operator step.

`config.workspace_root`, `config.artifact_root`, `config.primary_repo`, `config.repos`, and `config.verify_cwd` are required for new runs. `config.repos` is the authoritative managed-repo list: one primary repo plus any companion repos, each with its own scope. `config.scope` remains the primary repo's scope for compact prompts.

`state.last_repo_commits` and `state.last_trial_repo_commits` are optional multi-repo provenance maps keyed by repo path. They complement the TSV's single `commit` column, which continues to record only the primary repo commit. These maps are preserved when valid JSON state exists, but they are not reconstructed from the TSV alone and therefore are not part of the hard TSV/JSON consistency contract.

`state.current_labels` and `state.last_trial_labels` carry the normalized structured labels attached to the retained keep and the latest trial row. They are used for keep/stop label gates and should be preserved during resume and repair flows.

The `supervisor` object is optional. It is written by the runtime control plane (`autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py` and `autoresearch_supervisor_status.py`), is not required for normal session resume, and should be preserved if present.

## Detection Signals

At the start of every invocation, check for prior run artifacts in this order:

| Priority | Signal | File / Command | Weight |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | **JSON state** | `autoresearch-results/state.json` exists and is valid JSON with `version` field | **primary** |
| 2 | Results log | `autoresearch-results/results.tsv` exists and has a baseline row | strong |
| 3 | Lessons file | `autoresearch-results/lessons.md` exists | moderate |
| 4 | Git history | Recent commits with `experiment:` prefix | moderate |
| 5 | Output dirs | `debug/`, `fix/`, `security/`, `ship/` directories with timestamped subdirectories | weak |

If none of these signals are present, proceed with a fresh run (normal wizard flow).

## Helper Script

Prefer the bundled helper script over ad hoc TSV/JSON parsing:

```bash
python3 <skill-root>/scripts/autoresearch_resume_check.py --repo /path/to/repo
```

Here `<skill-root>` is the directory containing the loaded `SKILL.md`. In the common repo-local install this is usually `.agents/skills/codex-autoresearch`.

It reconstructs retained state from the TSV, tolerates parallel worker rows, and returns one of four decisions:

- `full_resume`
- `mini_wizard`
- `tsv_fallback`
- `fresh_start`

The helper's decision is the single control-plane source for:

- `autoresearch_launch_gate.py`
- `autoresearch_health_check.py`
- `autoresearch_resume_prompt.py`
- any runtime-managed resume prompt generation inside `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py`

Do not reimplement a second TSV/JSON reconciliation path in those scripts.

Use `--write-repaired-state` when TSV recovery is valid and you want to rewrite `state.json` before resuming.

## Recovery Priority Matrix

| # | Condition | Decision |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | JSON valid + helper reports `full_resume` | **Full resume** (skip wizard) |
| 2 | JSON valid + helper reports `mini_wizard` | **Mini-wizard** (1 round) |
| 3 | JSON missing or unusable + helper reports `tsv_fallback` | **TSV fallback** |
| 4 | Helper reports `fresh_start` | **Fresh start** |

### Priority 1: Full Resume

When the helper reports `full_resume`:

1. Restore loop variables from the JSON `state` and `config`.
2. Print a resume banner:
   ```
   Resuming from iteration {state.iteration}, retained metric: {state.current_metric}, best metric: {state.best_metric}.
   {state.keeps} kept, {state.discards} discarded, {state.crashes} crashed so far.
   Source: autoresearch-results/state.json (validated against TSV main rows)
   ```
3. Skip the wizard entirely.
4. Read the lessons file if present.
5. Let the runtime preflight confirm that the configured verify command still resolves before continuing.
6. If the current metric drifted, log a `drift` row and continue from the recalibrated state.
7. Background managed-runtime resume requires an existing `autoresearch-results/launch.json`. Foreground resume does not. Legacy repo-root artifacts are not restored into the new schema; switch to a fresh background launch instead of synthesizing compatibility artifacts.

### Priority 2: Mini-Wizard

When JSON exists but the helper reports `mini_wizard`:

1. Show what was detected:
   - prior run tag, iteration count, retained metric, and last status from JSON,
   - the helper's mismatch reasons (for example retained-metric mismatch, missing main iteration row, or stale counters).
2. Ask exactly one question:
   - resume from JSON state, or
   - start fresh and archive old artifacts.
3. If resuming, use JSON `config` as the authoritative config and re-confirm it in a single block.
4. If starting fresh, archive prior persistent run-control artifacts with `.prev` suffixes and proceed with the full wizard. In the managed-runtime path, this should happen through `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py launch --repo <primary_repo> --workspace-root <workspace_root> --fresh-start ...`.

### Priority 3: TSV Fallback

When JSON is missing or unusable but the helper reports `tsv_fallback`:

1. Reconstruct retained state from integer main rows in `autoresearch-results/results.tsv`.
2. If the user wants to resume, prefer:
   ```bash
   python3 <skill-root>/scripts/autoresearch_resume_check.py --repo /path/to/repo --write-repaired-state
   ```
3. Present one condensed confirmation block sourced from the reconstructed state.
4. After confirmation, continue from the next main iteration in the chosen mode. Background runs should create a fresh launch manifest at this point; foreground runs resume directly from results/state.
5. Do not start the detached runtime directly from bare TSV fallback without a confirmed launch manifest.

### Priority 4: Fresh Start

When the helper reports `fresh_start`:

1. Proceed with the normal wizard flow.
2. Rename prior persistent run-control artifacts in `autoresearch-results/` to `.prev` variants if they exist. In the managed-runtime path, this archival is performed by `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py launch --repo <primary_repo> --workspace-root <workspace_root> --fresh-start ...`.
3. Keep `autoresearch-results/lessons.md` unless it is clearly corrupt.

Legacy repo-root artifacts such as `research-results.tsv`, `autoresearch-state.json`, `autoresearch-launch.json`, `autoresearch-runtime.json`, and `autoresearch-runtime.log` do not participate in recovery. If they are detected, return:

```text
Found legacy repo-root autoresearch artifacts. This version uses workspace-owned autoresearch-results/. Start a fresh run or move/archive the old artifacts.
```

## Edge Cases

### Corrupt JSON

If `autoresearch-results/state.json` exists but is not valid JSON, treat it as unusable. Rename to `.bak` if you need to preserve it, then rely on TSV fallback or fresh start.

### Corrupt Results Log

If `autoresearch-results/results.tsv` is missing a baseline row, has a broken header, or contains unparsable metric cells, treat it as corrupt and start fresh.

### Different Goal

If the recovered config clearly belongs to a different goal than the current request, start fresh and archive the old run-control artifacts to `.prev` through `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py launch --repo <primary_repo> --workspace-root <workspace_root> --fresh-start ...`.


## Integration Points

- **autonomous-loop-protocol.md:** Run the launch gate before the wizard. Initialize new run artifacts only after baseline is measured.
- **results-logging.md:** Main integer rows define retained state; worker rows are audit detail only.
- **interaction-wizard.md:** Mini-wizard uses helper mismatch reasons instead of raw row counts.
- **health-check-protocol.md:** Deep integrity checks use the resume helper, not row-count heuristics.
- **exec-workflow.md:** Exec mode skips session resume, uses scratch JSON state, and requires the workflow to clean up scratch state before exit.
